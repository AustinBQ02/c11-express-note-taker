# c11-express-note-taker
This is challenge 11 for the UT Coding Bootcamp: Express.js Note Taker.

## Description

This project is a Note Taker app built using Express.js and deployed to Heroku in order to better understand how to build out the back end, connect it to the provided front end, and get it all working in a production environment.

Primary lessons learned were that scope still matters and that punctuation can be sneaky.
